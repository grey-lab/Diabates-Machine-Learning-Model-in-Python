# Diabates-Machine-Learning-Model-in-Python

Given diabetes2.csv data-set. The diagnostic, binary-valued variable investigated is whether the patient shows signs of diabetes.</br> Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.</br>
Number of Instances: 768 Number of Attributes: 8 plus class</br>
For Each Attribute: (all numeric-valued) : </br>
+ preg: Number of times pregnant</br>
+ plas: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test</br>
+ pres: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)</br>
+ skin: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)</br>
+ insu: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)</br>
+ mass:Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)</br>
+ pedi:Diabetes pedigree function</br>
+ age:Age(years)</br>
+ class: Class variable (0 or 1) – class value 1 is interpreted as "tested positive for diabetes"</br>
Using Python’s Jupyter notebook and Python’s scikit-learn library, develop a simple regression model with this data.</br>
