# Diabates-Machine-Learning-Model-in-Python

Given diabetes2.csv data-set. The diagnostic, binary-valued variable investigated is whether the patient shows signs of diabetes. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.
Number of Instances: 768 Number of Attributes: 8 plus class
For Each Attribute: (all numeric-valued)
 preg: Number of times pregnant
 plas: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
 pres: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
 skin: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
 insu: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
 mass:Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
 pedi:Diabetes pedigree function
 age:Age(years)
 class: Class variable (0 or 1) – class value 1 is interpreted as "tested positive for diabetes"
Using Python’s Jupyter notebook and Python’s scikit-learn library, develop a simple regression model with this data.
